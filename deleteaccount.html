    <p>All accounts in HealthFirst 1991 are created and managed by administrators. 
       Users cannot delete their own accounts. If you wish to delete your account or any associated data, 
       please contact your administrator directly. Admin contact details are visible within the app for your convenience, 
       and account deletion can be processed immediately by the administrator.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Personal profile information (name, contact info, etc.)</li>
      <li>Uploaded medical documents or reports, if legally permissible</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data That May Be Retained</h2>
    <p>Certain medical or legal records may need to be retained to comply with applicable laws. 
       These records will be securely stored for the legally required period and deleted afterward.</p>

    <h2>Confirmation of Deletion</h2>
    <p>Once the administrator processes your deletion request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your account access will be disabled.</li>
      <li>Deletion will happen immediately, except where legal retention is required.</li>
      <li>You will be notified by the administrator once deletion is complete. Through your contact medium.</li>
    </ul>
